Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User License

The following license terms and the Disclaimer of Warranty, below, apply to individual purchases of the Numerical Recipes Code download product, and to purchases of the Numerical Recipes Code CD-ROM.

By purchasing this disk or code download, you acquire a Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User License. This license lets you personally use Numerical Recipes code ("the code") on any number of computers, but only one computer at a time. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to access or use the code. You may, under this license, transfer precompiled, executable applications incorporating the code to other, unlicensed, persons, providing that (i) the application is noncommercial (e.g., does not involve the selling or licensing of the application for a fee or its use in developing commercial products or services), and (ii) the application was first developed, compiled, and successfully run by you, and (iii) the code is bound into the application in such a manner that it cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably be unbound and used in other programs. That is, under this license, your application user must not be able to use Numerical Recipes code as part of a program library or "mix and match" workbench.

Businesses and organizations that purchase this disk or code download, and that thus acquire one or more Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User Licenses, may permanently assign those licenses, in the number acquired, to individual employees. Such an assignment must be made before the code is first used and, once made, it is irrevocable and can not be transferred. In many cases, business and organizations may instead wish to purchase Numerical Recipes institutional subscriptions (see below), which have more flexibility.

Numerical Recipes Institutional Subscriber License

The following license terms and the Disclaimer of Warranty, below, apply to purchases of the Numerical Recipes institutional subscriptions.
1. By purchasing an institutional subscription you acquire a Numerical Recipes Institutional Subscriber License, as here described, valid for the term of your subscription. This license lets any number of users make unlimited use of Numerical Recipes code ("the code") on computers whose IP addresses are within the fixed block of addresses ("the block") specified at the time that the subscription was purchased, or as later amended by mutual agreement between you and Numerical Recipes Software (such amendment normally to be without cost). In acquiring this license, you warrant that you will not make use of Network Address Translation, Proxying, or any other technology, to allow the code to be accessible on a number of addresses greater than the number of IP addresses in the licensed block, except as provided for by a separate written agreement between you and Numerical Recipes Software.

2. In addition to the license granted by paragraph 1, you may, under this license, transfer precompiled, executable applications incorporating the code to other, unlicensed, machines or persons, providing that (i) the application was developed, compiled, and successfully run entirely on licensed computers within the block, and (ii) the code is bound into the application in such a manner that it cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably be unbound and used in other programs. That is, for the terms of this paragraph to apply, your application's user must not be able to use the Numerical Recipes code as part of a program library, or a "mix and match" workbench, or an integrated development environment or programming language.

3. At the end of your subscription, your right to use the code under the terms of paragraph 1 above shall expire, and you shall destroy all copies of Numerical Recipes code in your possession. Already-compiled applications that have previously qualified under paragraph 2 above shall continue to be licensed for use of the incorporated code in perpetuity. However, such applications may not be recompiled from Numerical Recipes code unless you purchase a new institutional subscription. (In practice, this means that you must maintain your subscription during the active life of your application, but may allow it to lapse when you are no longer maintaining your application.)
