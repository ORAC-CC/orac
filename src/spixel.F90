! Name: spixel.F90
!
! Purpose:
! Defines the SPixel, or "super pixel" module. This structure holds
! geometry, Radiative Transfer Model and other information relating to the
! pixel (or "super pixel") being processed.
!
! Also encapsulates various useful routines and defines check_value.
!
! Note: Most allocatable SPixel arrays are allocated in the subroutine
! Alloc_SPixel. However, it is necessary to allocate the Ym array size in
! Get_Measurements (as the number of channels is dependent on the geometry of
! the super pixel).
!
! History:
! 2000/11/24, AS: Original version
! 2000/12/01, AS: Removed underscores from Geom_t variable names and changed
!    Sunzen to Solzen.
! 2000/12/20, AS: Changed to an allocatable structure
! 2001/01/29, KS: Added transmittance at surface (Tsf), air mas factors SEC_o
!    and SEC_v, and transmittance along a slant path Tsf_o and Tsf_v.
!    Added Xb, X0 and Xn state vectors.
! 2001/02/15, KS: Added Ind substructure (numbers and indicies of channels)
!    Note: These have the same definitions as the corresponding Ctrl variables,
!    however they have been modified to account for the geometry (i.e. day,
!    twilight, night). These get calculated in Get_Geometry.
! 2001/02/21, AS: Added Tbc to LW structure. Previously missing from model data.
!    Removed Tsf parameters from the LW structure.
! 2001/03/06, AS: Change in use of Tsf parameters. RTM%SW and LW now both
!    contain Tsf, for appropriate channels. RTM overall struct contains Tsf_o
!    and Tsf_v, for all solar channels (mixed channel values supplied from the
!    LW RTM data). New quantities Ref_Clear and dRef_Clear_dRS added to RTM
!    struct.
! 2001/03/07, AS: New LW value dB_dTs.
! 2001/04/11, AS: Changes arising from development of Invert_Marquardt. Added
!    solar constant f0. Not strictly a SPixel value as it is the same for all
!    SPixels in the image, although there may be pixels for which it does not
!    apply (night, twilight). Also using named constant for arrays of size
!    MaxStateVar. Corrected Sx to 2-d, was previously 1-d. Removed SPixel%Xn
!    array (current state vector for inversion). Added index of cloud class for
!    first guess state vector: FGCloudClass, also First Guess phase FGPhase, and
!    current phase and cloud class  SPixel%Phase and SPixel%Class. New arrays
!    for current upper and lower limits on state variables, XLLim and XULim.
! 2001/05/17, AS: Added measurement error covariance Sy.
! 2001/06/05, AS: Added Xn and Sn to main SPixel structure. New arrays for FG
!    and AP selection options. New indices MDAD_LW/SW and illumination flag
!    Illum.
! 2001/07/04, AS: Comments updated.  LastX0 and LastY0 added to Loc structure.
!    Used to record the location of the last successfully retrieved solution
!    SPixel%XnSav, so that validity of that solution at a given location can be
!    checked. XnSav and SnSav introduced. These hold the last "good" state
!    vector while Xn and Sn hold the most recent.
! 2001/08/03, AS: Updated Loc structure to include YSeg0, YSegC, YSegn, for
!    referencing pixels within a data segment as opposed to the whole image.
!    **************** ECV work starts here *************************************
! 2001/02/23, AS: Re-applying some changes from 2001/2.
! 2002/08/14, CP: Add in a new variable that tells you about the cloud
!    characteristics around the pixel of concern
! 2002/12/13, CP: Add in the geopotential height )
! 2011/02/23, AS: Cloud flags converted to real, rather than byte, to match
!    current ORAC data.
! 2011/03/23, AS: Removal of super-pixel averaging. No need to allocate mask and
!    cloud or surface flags to Ctrl%Resoln%Space. Assume 1 pixel processed at a
!    time so only 1 flag needed. Removed Fracnext (was used to set a priori /
!    first guess error on fraction). Removed redundant struct members YSegc,
!    YSegn. Re-size FG array, phase removed (follow-up from phase change removal)
! 2011/04/08, AS: Phase change removal. On checking code in GetX and
!    InvertMarquardt, SPixel%Phase, Class and FGPhase are no longer required.
! 2011/04/20, AS:  Extension to handle multiple instrument views. The viewing
!    geometry becomes a set of arrays, e.g. 1 value of sat. zen angle per view.
!    New to Ind struct: Nviews and View_Idx.
! 2012/10/07, CP: Added in CWP variable and CWP error
! 2012/12/08, MJ: Added data types and structures for netcdf output.
! 2012/01/08, CP: Added channel info  for netcdf output.
! 2012/01/15, CP: Changed netcdf definitions. Added albedo
! 2012/06/15, CP: Changed illum into an array of ny variables
! 2012/10/04, CP: Added in new variables
! 2013/01/17, MJ: Adds code to accommodate uncertainties of ctt and cth
! 2013/10/02, CP/GT: Added in variable to calculate degrees of freedom of signal
! 2014/01/16, GM: Added spixel_y_to_ctrl_y_index.

!    subroutines into this module.
! 2015/01/19, GM: Put XAUX.F90, XMDAD.F90, and XSDAD.F90 into this module.
! 2015/01/30, AP: Remove redundant fields.
! 2015/02/04, GM: Changes related to the new missing channel, illumination, and
!    channel selection code.
! 2015/03/02, AP: Adding terms for aerosol retrieval. Remove Ctrl argument from
!    check_value routines. Remove check_value.
! 2015/07/29, AP: Remove QC.
! 2015/08/13, AP: Add Calculate_ND for NDVI and NDSI calculation.
! 2015/11/18, GM: Add CTH_corrected and CTH_corrected_uncertainty.
! 2016/01/20, GM: Move fields in RTM_LW_t and RTM_SW_t that are common to both
!    up one level into SPixel_RTM_t.
